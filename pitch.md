# Title of Project
​
## Overview
Summary of project you will build.
Why did you pick this game?
​First Person Shooter games have aim. I have a problem aimming under pressure in these games so I thought why not make a game I could use on my spare time to help me correct it
## Game rules
How is this game played?
Describe any scoring.
Describe win/lose conditions.
​
The game is played with a mouse
Scores are kept track based on how many buttons the user clicks on properly meaning if it's the right color or not
If it is right color button then the user gets a point
if not the user gets a minus 1 point
The user will lose if the goal is not met
if the user meets the goal then they win

## User Stories
"As a user..."
"When I do..."
​
As a user I see there are 3 buttons
When I click start game I will see a countdown to get ready
A timer to see how much time I have at the top, the color and the goal
When I click on the right color it will give me a point
When I click on the wrong color i will lose a point
Whenever I click a button, the color needed will change and the positions of the buttons will change
When I look at the background it changes color to make the colors harder to see
When the game is over there will be an option to go back or restart



## MVP Checklist
List out requirements and dates to complete by.
Organize these into most foundational to your functionality, to least.


Whenever the user clicks on the right color button they get a point
    There will be an if statement wondering if the button clicked is matching with the button 
If the button is not right then their score goes down and can even go to the negatives
    There will be a variable declaring score that will go up or down based on the button clicked
Whenever the user clicks on the right or wrong button it changes the color and position
    Score variable
    So the user can see where they are at in the game in comparison to the goal in order to win
make sure the buttons don't spawn on eachother
Make a game state
    makes sure the user doesn't click any buttons when the game isn't running
Make a timer
    The timer is to give the user a set time to complete a goal 
When the game is over give the option for the user to go back or restart
    this will ensure a reset button that is required
Fixed Goal
    The fixed goal will make sure the game is winnable

What is a really cool idea that you don't have time to work on right now?
An AI with its own cursor so you can see the movement of the AI and try to beat it
whenever you hover with your cursor on the color button it will also have a key you need to click on instead of just clicking on it with your mouse
