# Click-Race
The player has their own cursor and will use the cursor to hover or click on specific buttons

The user will be given a button with a random color to click on
The buttons will change color every time they are clicked on

There will be a timer for both the AI or just the player to get as many as they can

It either will be a player vs AI where the AI have their own cursor or I will make the game player vs. time

Racing against the clock to get a certain score

Bonus:
Including the AI to have its own cursor.
adding different levels of difficulty whether it is making the button smaller, bigger, or making the AI faster.
making an endless mode where you click on as many as you can and see how far you can get clicking
